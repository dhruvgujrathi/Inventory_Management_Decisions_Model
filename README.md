# Inventory_Management_Decisions_Model
Decision analysis (DA) is a systematic, quantitative, and visual approach to addressing and evaluating the important choices that businesses sometimes face. Ronald A. Howard, a professor of Management Science and Engineering at Stanford University, is credited with originating the term in 1964. The idea is used by large and small corporations alike when making various types of decisions, including management, operations, marketing, capital investments, or strategic choices. Decision analysis is a systematic, quantitative, and visual approach to making strategic business decisions. Decision analysis uses a variety of tools and also incorporates aspects of psychology, management techniques, and economics. Risk, capital investments, and strategic business decisions are areas where decision analysis can be applied. Decision trees and influence diagrams are visual representations that help in the analysis process. Critics argue that decision analysis can easily lead to analysis paralysis and, due to information overload, the inability to make any decisions at all.
